## Opening a Pull Request

You most likely want to do your work on a feature branch based on main.
Typical naming convention is `username/feature`. Username could be 
your initials or some other similar identifier. Feature could be a short 
description of the feature or a reference to the jira ticket number

Preface the PR title with JIRA issue number and security risk (e.g. `[RW-123][risk=no]`)
to the PR title. This will allow automated deployment processes to generate appropriate 
documentation. 

Please ensure that both integration and unit tests are passing.

## Security Risk Levels

Risk levels indicate to our security review team some measure of the impact
the change might have on anything security related. Sensitive information that
relates to users or patients would be an example where we need to indicate the
level of risk involved. 

* **no**: None 
* **low**: Low chance of potential impact to, or exposure of patient data
* **moderate**: Moderate chance of potential impact to, or exposure of patient data
* **severe**: Severe chance of potential impact to, or exposure of patient data

## PR Approval Process

* In most cases, assign and get approval from one reviewer. PRs that may have an impact on other developers should include more than one, preferably two.
* Ensure all CI tests and Codacy checks pass
* Tag Product Owner and Designer for PRs that include UI improvements

## PR Completion

* Use the "Squash and Merge" feature in github
* Delete the feature branch after all work is complete
