    <!--
      Delete the last remaining ACTIVE workspaces with BillingMigrationStatus other than 1 (NEW)
      which designates One Project Per Workspace (1PPW) - which has been true for all new workspaces
      created since 2019.

      https://precisionmedicineinitiative.atlassian.net/browse/RW-8705

      There are 31 of these in Test, and none in any other environment, according to
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspace
      WHERE active_status = 0 /* ACTIVE */ AND billing_migration_status != 1 /* NEW */ ;

      We are unable to delete these by our usual means, because the user which created them no
      longer exists - perhaps why these were not migrated originally.  This also does not delete
      their associated resources, but we are addressing such cases as part of a more general
      cleanup in https://precisionmedicineinitiative.atlassian.net/browse/RW-8018
