    "**Jupyter Notebooks** (like this one) are web applications that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Like a traditional lab notebook, Jupyter Notebooks allow you to capture a complete record of your procedures, analyses, and observations such that another scientist may reproduce your observations.\n",

    "    > Ex. Use our CDR documentation to learn that the Person table contains fields such as \"person_id\" and \"year_of_birth\"\n",
