# Cron jobs

The Researcher Workbench (RW) system includes a number of [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
jobs to run maintenance or synchronization tasks which cannot easily be handled in response to
user-triggered web requests.

Typical examples of cron-style tasks include:

* Cluster maintenance / auto-restart
* Synchronizing user state from external data sources
* Periodic security / compliance audit calculations
* Periodic resource cleanup

All cron jobs are configured as App Engine scheduled tasks; see the
[App Engine docs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/config/cron) for more info.

## Notes

* Cron jobs are implemented as normal API handlers / controller methods in the backend.
* By convention, tag the Swagger method with a name that includes "offline". This clearly identifies
  the resulting controller class as offline-only.
    * For example: "offlineUser" tag --> OfflineUserController.java.
* Each Swagger method must also be tagged with "cron".
    * This causes the CronInterceptor to be applied, ensuring that the method can only be called
      from AppEngine's cron infrastructure.
* The deadline on a cron job is __10 minutes__.
    * If we end up needing tasks that take longer, we might split the task out into a separate
      service with different scaling parameters. (
      See [docs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/config/cronref#deadlines)).
* __Warning__: Cron jobs are executing in an environment where the App Engine service account is the
  authenticated user,
  __not__ an end-user. Care must be taken to ensure the cron job is always using the proper
  service-account credentials, and/or creating impersonated credentials (e.g. for FireCloud API
  calls).

## Adding a new cron job

It's straightforward to copy existing patterns when creating a new cron job. Key file locations:

- [workbench-api.yaml](https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/blob/main/api/src/main/resources/workbench-api.yaml) (
  API definition; search for "cron")
- [OfflineClusterController.java](https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/blob/main/api/src/main/java/org/pmiops/workbench/api/OfflineClusterController.java) (
  controller)
- [cron_base.yaml](https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/blob/main/api/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cron_base.yaml) (
  App Engine cron config)

## Alternative behavior by environment

Modify the corresponding cron_{env}.yaml file to override the cron settings for a given environment.
This extends the settings found in cron_base.yaml, keyed by URL.

Include the special key "aou_skip_reason" to skip a cron in a given environment

## Local testing

You can test a cron endpoint locally with curl:

```
curl --header "X-AppEngine-Cron: true" localhost:8081/v1/cron/updateWidgetConfiguration
```

Not ideal but you can test the schedule string for your cron by deploying an instance and reading
its logs. You should be able to see the cron scheduler hitting the endpoints. Not that useful if
your scheduled intervals are long but you can at least verify that the schedule string is
deployable. A bad configuration will error out on the deploy-api command with something
like `Bad configuration: schedule every 5 seconds failed to parse`

```
./project.rb deploy-api --no-promote --version songe --project all-of-us-workbench-test
gcloud app logs tail -s api
```

## Viewing logs

One a new cron endpoint has been deployed to test, you should be able to see it in the App Engine "
Cron jobs" tab (see
[this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/cronjobs?project=all-of-us-workbench-test)
for the test environment). Recent success / failure will be highlighted, with links out to
Stackdriver logs.
