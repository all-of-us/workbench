<div class="text">Hello, this is an automated email from the ${ALL_OF_US} Researcher Workbench. This email was
  generated at the request of ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME}, a user of the Workbench from ${INSTITUTION_NAME} who would
  like to pay for cloud services to be used for their work in the Workbench.
</div>
<div class="text">
  Background: Analysis work conducted in the All of Us Researcher Workbench makes use of cloud computing
  resources provided by Google Cloud. After a researcher consumes any initial credits provided to them by
  the All of Us program, they must provide their own means of payment for any Google Cloud resources they require.
  This requires that a Google Cloud Billing Account is selected or created, and configured to allow that account to be used from the All of Us Workbench.
</div>

<div class="text">
  This message is sent to ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME} and Carahsoft, an NIH and Google Cloud partner who can
  assist in creating or configuring a Google Cloud Billing Account. If your institution already has an existing
  relationship with an NIH/Google Cloud partner, Carahsoft will refer you to that partner.
</div>

<div class="text">
  Requester information:
  <ul>
    <li>Name: ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME}
    <li>Email: ${USER_CONTACT_EMAIL}
    <li>Phone: ${USER_PHONE}
    <li>Institution: ${INSTITUTION_NAME}
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="text">Payment configuration requested:
  <ul>
    <li>Requested payment type: ${PAYMENT_METHOD}
    <li>Is this work NIH-funded and eligible for the STRIDES Program?: ${NIH_FUNDED}
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="text">
  Instructions:
  <ol>
    <li>Set up a Google Cloud (GCP) billing account
    <li>Link the following user IDs to that billing account:  ${USERNAME} <br/>
    <a href="mailto:terra-billing@terra.bio">terra-billing@terra.bio</a>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="text">
  To do this, go to the "Billing Accounts" tab at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing">https://console.cloud.google.com/billing</a> and
  check the box next to the billing account you’d like to edit Billing Account".
  Then click on “Account Management” on the left hand panel. Go to “Permissions” on the right hand panel
  and select "Add member". Add terra-billing@terra.bio and ${USERNAME}.  In the dropdown for that member,
  select role "Billing" -> "Billing Account User". Don't forget the "Save" button!
</div>
 <div class="text">
  It is also through this Billing Portal that you can <a href="https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360057589931-How-to-set-up-and-use-GCP-budget-alerts"> set up billing alerts</a> to notify you when you reach a
  certain spending threshold! Please work with your representative to set this up.
