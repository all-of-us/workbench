<div>Hello,</div>
<div>We are writing to you on behalf of the ${ALL_OF_US} Research Program’s Researcher Workbench
  Support team. A workspace you own titled <b>'${WORKSPACE_NAME}' (${WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE})</b> has been
  flagged by the ${ALL_OF_US} Research Program’s Resource Access Board (RAB) as potentially in
  violation of
  program policies.</div>
<div>The reason this workspace was flagged is the following:</div>
<ul>
  <li>${LOCKING_REASON}</li>
</ul>
<div>As the RAB continues to review your workspace, we are requesting that you take action to
  sufficiently address the concern above within the next two weeks. Once you have made the
  requested revisions, please email ${RAB_SUPPORT_EMAIL} to confirm. Failure to address the issue
  may result in permanent removal of the workspace.</div>
<div>The following restrictions will be placed on your workspace while it is flagged:</div>
<b>
<ul>
  <li>The data builder, analyses tab will be frozen out</li>
  <li>Current workspace actions will be disabled
  <ul>
    <li>Cannot duplicate or clone a workspace</li>
    <li>Cannot copy artifacts out of the workspace into other workspaces</li>
    <li>Cannot delete a workspace</li>
    <li>Cannot download a workspace</li>
    <li>Cannot share a workspace</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The ‘about (e.g., workspace description)’ tab can still be edited</li>
  <li>All data in the workspace will be preserved as it was prior to freezing</li>
</ul>
</b>
<div>If you have any questions about the decision to freeze your workspace and the next steps that
  are needed from you, please contact the ${ALL_OF_US} Resource Access Board at
  ${RAB_SUPPORT_EMAIL}. Thank you for your understanding and patience.</div>
<div>Best,</div>
<div>The ${ALL_OF_US} Researcher Workbench Support Team</div>
