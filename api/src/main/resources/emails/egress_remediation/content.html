<div>Dear Researcher,</div>
<div>This is an automated email from the ${ALL_OF_US} Security Team at Vanderbilt University Medical
  Center. We received an alert related to activity on your account <b>${USERNAME}</b>. This
  alert was triggered because our monitoring system detected potential data egress from
  your workspace. Please be advised users are not permitted to pull any row-level/participant-level data out of the
  Researcher Workbench, per the All of Us Research Program Data User Code of Conduct ${ALL_OF_US}.

  To confirm your activity, please answer the following questions (if applicable):
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Can you please confirm your account activity, and the details of that activity?

    <li>Can you confirm no row-level/participant-level data was downloaded to your local device during this activity?
  </ul>

  you may request a temporary increase in your egress threshold limit by filling out and
  submitting the Large Data Download request form (add hyperlink to form or request page).
