<div class="text">Hello, and thank you for using the All of Us Researcher Workbench. Your access to All of Us
Registered Tier data requires annual renewal, and your renewal was due by
  <b>${EXPIRATION_DATE}</b>.</div>
<div>Because your renewal was not completed in time, you have lost access to the data and to any
  workspaces in the Workbench. Any code or data you’ve created will remain as-is, but will be
  inaccessible until you complete renewal.</div>
<div class="text">Renewal consists of a few steps similar to those you completed in order to initially gain
  access to the data. To see what you need to do, log in to your account at ${URL}.</div>
