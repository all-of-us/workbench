<div class="text">Hello, and thank you for using the ${ALL_OF_US} Researcher Workbench. Your access to ${ALL_OF_US}
Registered Tier data requires annual renewal, and your renewal was due by
  <b>${EXPIRATION_DATE}</b>.</div>
<div class="text">Because your renewal was not completed in time, you have lost access to the data and to any
  workspaces in the Workbench. Any code or data youâ€™ve created will remain as-is, but will be
  inaccessible until you complete renewal.</div>
<div class="text">Renewal consists of a few steps similar to those you completed in order to initially gain
  access to the data. To see what you need to do, log in to your account at ${URL}.</div>
<div class="text">If you have questions, contact our support team by replying to this email or clicking the
