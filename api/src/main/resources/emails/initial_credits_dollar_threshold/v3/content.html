    This is a reminder that you have used ${USED_CREDITS} of the initial credits
    offered to your <i>${ALL_OF_US}</i> Researcher Workbench account ${USERNAME}
    by the <i>${ALL_OF_US}</i> Research Program.
  </div>

  <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #d4a000">
    The remaining balance of your initial credits is ${CREDIT_BALANCE}.

    <i
      >To avoid any losses to your analyses and files, please add a valid Google
      Cloud Platform billing account to your workspace. If you haven't yet
      established a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing account to pay for your
      research yet, we recommend you do that now.</i

  </div>

  <div>
    Once you use all of your initial credits, you will not be able to launch new
    analysis environments and any active cloud environments, data and storage
    resources (e.g., workspace buckets and persistent disks) may be deleted.

    Workbench 2.0, you will be required to <b>duplicate</b> the workspace, and
    add an updated billing pod. To learn more about creating a billing pod, see
