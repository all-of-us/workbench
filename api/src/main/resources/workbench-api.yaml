    The API for the AllOfUs workbench.

    Throughout, we use integer/int64 in preference to string/date-time because Swagger's
    date formatting is inconsistent between server and client. Time values are stored as
    milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.

    Note: all requests tagged as "cron" must have the header X-Appengine-Cron:
    true, which app engine itself only sets when invoking as a cronjob.
    See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/config/cron#securing_urls_for_cron
    and o.p.w.interceptors.CronInterceptor which implements the header check.

      summary: Get the locking metadata for a notebook
      description: |
        Get the locking metadata for a notebook, if available.  If the notebook is not locked
        (e.g. at first creation) this may be empty.  Additionally, the caller of this endpoint
        may not have the appropriate permissions to determine who is locking this notebook.
        When this is the case, the lastLockedBy field is set to UNKNOWN.

      Note: all requests tagged as "cloudTask" must have the header X-AppEngine-QueueName:
      to the queue name, which app engine itself only sets (and overrides internally) when invoking
      cloud task. See
      https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#reading_app_engine_task_request_headers
      and o.p.w.interceptors.CloudTaskInterceptor which implements the header check.

      Using body parameter ref ArrayOfLong instead of defining array of type long here because of

        Authorities are a tool used to add discrete permissions to users. We currently
        define the following authorities:
          * DEVELOPER: Grants access to some internal-only
            administrative endpoints, including group management and runtime
            management. Intended to be granted for devops needs, e.g. for oncall.
          * ACCESS_CONTROL_ADMIN: This is actually basically a user admin authority, for people
            to perform actions on a user's enabled status and manual verification.
          * FEATURED_WORKSPACE_ADMIN: Allows a user to publish workspaces
          * COMMUNICATIONS_ADMIN: Allows a user to post a Status Alert banner
          * SECURITY_ADMIN: Allows a user to respond to egress alerts by deleting all runtimes in a project
          * INSTITUTION_ADMIN: Allows a user to create, delete, and update Institute entities
          * RESEARCHER_DATA_VIEW: Allows a user to view admin-only data (or aggregations of data)
              for users, workspaces, and similar user-created content.

        The following authorities are deprecated and should no longer be used:

This may be a source or standard concept ID, depending on the tree for the criteria.
            Similar to a code, multiple criteria may reference the same concept ID due to multiple occurrences of a concept in the criteria tree. In other cases a criteria may share the concept ID of its parent, e.g. in the PPI tree a question and child answer share a concept id.

            Predicates to apply to the search parameters. Aggregate modifiers (i.e. NUM_OF_OCCURRENCES) are applied independently to each SearchParameter and furthermore, are applied independently to any group elements within those SearchParameters.
            Consider the following example query scenario.
            Example criteria tree: - parent
              - child1
              - child2

            Curated dataset contains 1 participant with 1 event each of concepts child1 and child2. Search request is made on "parent", with a modifier of {type: NUM_OF_OCCURRENCES, operands: [2]}.
            This does not match - the participant would need to have at least 2 events of type child1 and/or of child2 and/or of parent (in the event that "parent" corresponds to a real concept in the data).
            Additionally, aggregate modifiers are applied secondarily to other modifiers. For example, combining the AGE_AT_EVENT with NUM_OF_OCCURRENCES - first we filter down all events by the age predicate, then we count occurrences.

Measurements and Physical Measurements have overlap in many areas such as body weight, but the difference is standard(measurements) and source(physical measurements).

        Users authenticate with our API using a Google-issued OIDC access token.

        This is a non-standard use of Swagger 2.0's oauth2 type. The aou_auth
        entry under security (below) serves to establish the fact
        that all endpoints are protected. This annotation ensures that client
        libraries know to send bearer tokens when calling, but otherwise only
        provides a minimal OAuth2 implementation. Future Swagger versions may
        provide a better mapping to our authorization and authentication flows.

        We use the OAuth2 authorization code grant with the PKCE extension
        (https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) on public clients
        (https://oauth.net/2/client-types/). However, Google only supports the
        authorization code grant for confidential clients. To enable public client
        access, we provide an endpoint that forwards token-related requests to
        Google with the client secret added.

        Because we do not provide a full OAuth implementation, adding the scope
        property is at best documentation and at worst may lead to unexpected
        behavior. Instead, we document them here.

        Required Google scopes:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
        - openid
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile

        In addition to the above, the following scope is required for endpoints
        that leverage billing information:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-billing

  This file is for endpoints we do NOT intend to generate client libraries for
  and advertise to notebook developers. Endpoints we DO want notebook developers to use should
  go in client_api.yaml.

  This file references parameters, paths, and definitions specified in
  client_api.yaml; the two files get merged together into a merged.yaml file at build time.

  If validation fails, gradle:generateWorkbenchApi fails claiming this file does not exist.

  For separate validation (with some false positives), do:
  ./project.rb validate-swagger
