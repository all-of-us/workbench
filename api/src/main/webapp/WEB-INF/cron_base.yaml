    Export user and workspace data to RDR.
    RDR export is hard-coded to 9pm CT, to align with VUMC expectations that the daily export is run at a time
    that is (1) after the close of normal business working hours, and (2) early enough in the evening that the
    entire export (and downstream data flows) can complete before start of the next business day.
