This is an experimental new module as of May 2023, intended to help us migrate to the new Leonardo 
client published by that team at 
[The Broad Institute's JFrog repository](https://broadinstitute.jfrog.io/ui/packages/gav:%2F%2Forg.broadinstitute.dsde.workbench:leonardo-client_2.11?name=leonardo-client&type=packages).

It consists of copies of the older (Swagger-generated) client's classes, with a "NewLeonardo" 
prefix to keep them distinct.  We expect to drop this prefix when the migration is
complete.
