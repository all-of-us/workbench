    Central to the mission of the All of Us Research Program is the collection of information
    from diverse groups of people within the U.S. population. However, the Program must
    recognize the potential for resources collected in good faith to be used towards social
    detriment, like stigmatization. Stigmatizing research is any research proposal, project,
    or question that has the potential to instigate or promote marginalization, discrimination,
    or loss of status by a person or group of people. Stigma may be inherent
    in the research design (i.e. the formation of a research question based on prejudicial
    biases) or a byproduct of the research findings (i.e. the interpretation of findings in
    such a way as to promote negative stereotypes) and may be intentional or unintentional.
    While complete elimination of stigmatizing research based on use of the All of Us data
    resources is likely impossible, the Program is taking steps in earnest to prevent resource
    use with the potential to stigmatize and to punish people who misuse the resource to the
    detriment of others as appropriate.

  <div class="stigma-text">
    Stigma may be understood as convergence of the following components (adapted from
    <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363">Link
    and Phelan, 2001</a>):

  <ol class="stigma-list">
    <li>
      <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">The identification and labeling of human differences.</span>
      <span class="stigma-text">
        Not all differences are deemed socially relevant. Certain differences—such as differences
        in skin color, ethnicity, country of origin, ancestry, sex, gender, sexual orientation,
        socioeconomic status, educational attainment, disability status, and body type—are
        considerably more prone to stigma than others. Salience of labels in such domains are
        dependent on a process during which gross oversimplification of an attribute or
        characteristic creates artificial categories, upon which contextually-specific social
        selection occurs.

    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
        The linking of labeled persons by dominant cultural belief to undesirable
        characteristics and formation of negative stereotypes.
      </span>
      <span class="stigma-text">
        A key feature in this process is the provision of characteristics that may be linked
        to one or more social labels. Scientific research can provide just such fodder, and
        the result can be arbitrary stereotypes socially perpetuated under the banner of science.

    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
        Separation of people into categories of “us” and “them” by applying said stereotypes.
      </span>
      <span class="stigma-text">
        The logical next step after the perpetration of a negative stereotype is the use
        of that stereotype to define in-groups and out-groups.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
        The experience of loss of status and discrimination by labeled persons.
      </span>
      <span class="stigma-text">
        This is the ultimate output of the stigma process. Here, “out-group” members are
        downwardly placed, with regards to the “in-group,” and subjected to detrimental
        treatment, consideration, or distinction based upon label(s), rather than merit.
        Discrimination can be leveraged by an individual or group towards an individual
        or collection of individuals. However, discrimination is particularly dangerous
        in its structural form, when discriminatory behavior becomes culturally accepted
        and accumulates to shape institutional practices that work to the disadvantage of
        labeled group(s), even in the absence of individual prejudices or discrimination.

    <li>
      <span class="stigma-bold stigma-text">
        The exercise of social, economic, political, or other power that reinforces the
        above processes, translating them into significant consequences for labeled
        individuals.
      </span>
      <span class="stigma-text">
        Without the uneven distribution of power, in-group prejudices would not carry
        the same negative consequences for out-group members.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="stigma-text">
    When these components converge, they produce widespread attitudes and beliefs that
    lead people to reject, avoid, or fear those they perceive as being different,
    resulting in detrimental inequities and unfair treatment at either the individual
    or group level.
